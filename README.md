================

I like learning new programming languages, and I like reading books.  So I will often attempt to learn a new programming language by buying a book and reading it and working the exercises.  This repo is the code I've generated while trying to work through Programming Ruby, aka The Pickaxe Book.

This is my second attempt, now on the 4th edition of The Pickaxe Book.  I think I'll get farther this time because learning at least some Ruby is a requirement for working with Puppet.  (Also the Pythonistas at the current job seem to be outnumbered by the Rubyists.)
